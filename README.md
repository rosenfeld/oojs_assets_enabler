# What is jasmine\_assets\_enabler?

This is a minimal Rails application with support for the asset pipeline
bundled with the Jasmine specs runner.

There are some examples bundled with this app. Just copy these files to
your (non-Rails) project root and run:

    rake jasmine:serve

Then browse to http://localhost:5000 and start coding your specs in Jasmine.

Take a look at [this Jasmine enabled Grails sample application](https://github.com/rosenfeld/grails-jasmine).

Happy coding! :)
